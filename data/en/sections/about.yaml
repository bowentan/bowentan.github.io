# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a passionate software developer with interests in open-source projects of Python, Node.js, C/C++ and Lua and so on.
  I love to use NeoVim as my editor and have contributed in some interesting plugin projects.
  I am also enthusiastic about developing with Golang and Rust, and currently learning more deeply.
  Since undergraduate, I have been one of the administrators of the computing resources in the lab and learnt most of my knowledge about DevOps.
  As a CS PhD student, additionally, I mainly focused on algorithms and machine learning.
  Currently I extend my sight to deep learning models and large language models as well as their applications in various fields.
